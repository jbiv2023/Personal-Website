        <div class="secondParagraph">
            <p style="padding-bottom: 70px"> I grew up in Southern California and moved to Virginia when I was 21. I started my Computer Science 
                journey after changing my major of Biomedical engineering. I chose computer science for the diversity in which the skill set could be 
                applied. 

                <br>
                <br>
               In my free time I enjoy going on runs in mountainous terrain, enjoying quality time with friends and family 
               as well as playing in an occational soccer game.
               <br>
                <br>
                During my time at Virginia Tech I have learned; Java, C, Python, Git, Linux and so many more awesome and invaluable skillsets.
                I have done many projects that directly show what I am capable of as well as the potential as to what I can do when blessed 
                in working for a company that expresses, integrity, honesty, commitment and opportunity to not only their employees but to the community
                in which said company resides. 
                <br>
                <br>
                One thing that separates me from other individuals my age, is that I used to be a caregiver for my terminally ill father.
                Being an untrained caregiver starting at 18 was no easy task. Coordinating medication four times a day; to making sure he eats, doesnt walk out of the house
                alone and gets lost, communicating to family, friends and health specialists about the best care and all of his daily routines. This lasted a while, 
                until my mom took the lead when we moved to Virginia so I could pursue computer science. 

                <br>
                <br>

                I have learned so much through my journey, but the one thing that really sticks out is having the grit to keep on going despite any adversities. 
                And this is why I will do my absolute best with the career path that God intended me to have.

            When I came to Virginia my dream was to come to Virginia Tech, not only for their amazing 
            food, but also to be apart of an exceptional Computer Science program.  
            Now that I am near graduation, I want to share some aspects of my college works. 
            The first link is to a project a fellow Hokie was doing and was chosen to write 
            about her experience in an interview formatted article.
            The second link will take you to my personal GitHub account where I have 
            posted a few of the projects I have done at VT that are on my resume. These projects were not only fun to make 
            but they also expanded my understanding of programming.  My goal here is to portray my understanding of progamming as well as my clear communication abilities.
